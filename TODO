* Add in extra user restrictions
    * Individual Package overrides
        * Included and excluded (takes precedence over content rating restriction)
        * Probably through some sort of DB table:
            * User
            * Package
            * Action (ALLOW, DENY)
    * Package content rating restriction
        * Child's account vs Parent's account, both tied to the same Client
        * This would have to be in the Metadata I'm guessing
        * Each User has a Choice attribute
            * Everything (default)
            * R
            * MA
            * M
            * PG
            * G
        * If a Package has no Content Rating then (ALLOW/DENY)?
    * Restrict a User to viewing only jobs from their associated Client
        * Each User has a ForeignKey attribute tied to the Client table
        * If a User has no tied Client, then we allow them to see (ALL/NONE) jobs?
        * If a User is a superuser they can see ALL jobs in the system
    * 'Categories' page
        * Limit to just Super Users
    * 'Discover Media' page
        * Should this be restricted on a per-user/client basis?
        * Should this be restricted or just Super Users?
    * 'Clients' page
        * Super Users gets a list view of all Clients
        * Users get a detailed view of their specific Client
            * This means we need to modify the base template to be context sensitive

* Look into generic templates
    * 'List View' template
    * 'Item Edit' template
    * 'Item Add'  template
